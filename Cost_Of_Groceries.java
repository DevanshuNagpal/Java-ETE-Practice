item has a freshness value Ai and cost Bi.
Chef has decided to purchase all the items having a freshness value greater than equal to X. find the total cost of
groceries the chef buys.
Input format:
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and X â€” the number of items and the minimum freshness value an item should have.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the array A, denoting the freshness value of each item.
The third line contains N space-separated integers, the array B, denoting the cost of each item.
Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line, the total cost of the groceries Chef buys.
Example:
Input:
2 20
15 67
10 90
Output:
90
Explanation:
//N and X
//the array A, denoting the freshness value of each item
//the array B, denoting the cost of each item
//total cost of groceries the chef buys
Item 2 has freshness value greater than equal to X=20
Thus, Chef buys item 2
The total cost is 90
